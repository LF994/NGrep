# NGrep
Simple grep-like command line utility written on C# 

You don't need to install any build tools (like Visual Studio). MS provides command line csc.exe compiler with any Windows starting XP.
See cscc.bat for locations and verify what you have in your Windows. Use it as "cscc xyz.cs" to build your own C# program
File mk.bat will build everything, you can run "ngrep ?" for help.
